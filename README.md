# Measure effect of school brand using experiment

### Introduction

With the rising cost of education, some may start to question if an expensive degree from a private college is truly better than a more affordable degree from a public university. 

To address this question, a group of us at UC Berkeley MIDS program decided to take on the challenge. We designed an experiment to measure how much advantage a private college can give a candidate when applying for jobs on LinkedIn.


### Experiment Setup

#### 1. Realistic Fictitious Resumes:
In order to have a meaningful experiment, we want to make sure the candidates are very similar, except for where they received their education. Our team created four sets of resumes for four fictitious candidates and gave them very similar names. However, our fake candidates are very real. Our team generated four sets of real phone numbers for LinkedIn profiles, created four email addresses and four LinkedIn profiles with real friend requests. For comparison, we selected schools that are similar in ranking. 



#### 2. Application on LinkedIn
Since our candidates are not real, we chose to apply for jobs on LinkedIn to avoid in-person contact. Instead of submitting two applications at the same time, we staggered applications to minimize the impact of the two candidates have on each other. We targeted entry level jobs because having more work experience would introduce biases that are not related to college degrees. We also removed listings that requires cover letter or long written answers to make sure we do not introduce biases in our applications.


#### 3. Call backs
It was exciting to receive good news even for our fake candidates! It was amazing that our fake candidates actually received many interview invitations after their job applications. What we also learned from this project is to have confidence and keep applying for jobs. Even though it might be intimidating and stressful, it will be rewarding.
